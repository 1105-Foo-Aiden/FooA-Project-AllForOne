Description: A comprehensive collection of the API endpoints we've been accumulating to create a front and back end website

Peer Reviewer: Caleb Sylvia

Peer Review: Site works for the most part and is very simple and clean as it should be. Only issues is that madlibs threw an error when I submitted random letters to all of them, something might be wrong with the API and the reverse string is supposed to be alphanumerical but works as intended.
